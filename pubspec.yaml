  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/logo_wallpaper.png
     - assets/images/home_wallpaper.webp
     - assets/images/login_wallpaper.webp
     - assets/images/android_logo.png

  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: Inter

      - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Thin.ttf
        weight: 100
      - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ThinItalic.ttf
